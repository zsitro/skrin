Test websites on your small screen like it would appear on huge monitors

##Why?

There are several cases where I need to optimize or check a website on fullHD or bigger resolution while having only a 13" macbook with me. I tried one or two other alternatives (there are quite few) but none of them offered authentic preview and easy control over this problem

##How does it work?

Paste your URL into the top navigation panel, select a monitor size on the left to test with. Tick in fitWidth checkbox if you want to see the whole page shrinked into your browser window.

##What is it not for

- Test sites for mobile screens. There are tons of them already u can choose from.
- Test sites in shitty browsers

##Tested on

- Chrome latest OSX
- Firefox latest OSX

##Insall a local copy

Check out from git

```git clone git@github.com:zsitro/skrin.git
npm install
bower install
gulp serve
```

## Known issues

- Selecting a smaller screen from options while you have bigger browser window could result whatever, I don't know
- _fitHeight_ feature is coming soon, to disable double scrolling.
